Notebooks and code from my REU at University of Texas
-----
- All of the notebooks are descriptive in themselves. The most important for our purposes were: 
    - Unpickle SESNA.ipynb
    - Galactic ReAdjusted Models.ipynb (GRAM lol)
    - SESNA Galactic Fitting.ipynb
    - imputation comparisons.ipynb (unfinished)
- batchFit.py is the script used to run our fitting algorithm from terminal
- requirements.txt is a list of installations for a python environment I used to test an issue with the SEDFitter package
